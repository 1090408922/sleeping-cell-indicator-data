# sleeping-cell-indicator-data

This repository contains three groups of sleeping cell indicator data. Sleeping cell is a special kind of cell degradation. A cell is called degraded in case if it is not 100% functional - its services are suffering in terms of quality what affects user experience. There exist a vague classification of degraded cells depending on how much they affect the network operation:
- Degraded cell - which still carries some traffic, but the performance characteristics are slightly lower, than in case of fully operational cell.
- Crippled cell - is characterized by a severely decreased capacity due to a failure of a base station component.
- Catatonic cell - does not carry any traffic in one or both directions and is inoperable. This might be a result of severe equipment or software failure
